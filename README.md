# Treasure Checklist (GEODE MOD)

First Mod I programmed for Geometry Dash, publicly available on the Geode Modloader.

## Main Settings

- **Garage Button**: Whenever the player wants the button of the mod in the Garage Layer (Icon Kit), enabled by default.
- **Display Checkmark**: When disabled, the icons aren't greyed out, if you want to see all the designs. This icon is enabled by default.
- **Show Miscellaneous Rewards**: Displays rewards that aren't icons (like colors and death effects). This option is enabled by default.
- **Group by Chests**: All rewards you get from the Tier II chests are grouped instead of being displayed separately. This option is enabled by default.
- **Sort Golden Key rewards**: Displays the placement number of the rewards you get from Golden Key chests. This option is enabled by default.

## Experimental Settings

- **Wraith's Rewards**: Adds an extra page dedicated for all the rewards you get from The Wraith. This option is enabled by default.

## Developer Commentary

- The Mod hooks two layers in the game, GarageLayer (Icon Kit) and the SecretRewardsLayer (Treasure Room)
- In the Icon Kit, the mod adds a button in the "Shards-menu" node
- Most of the buttons, menus and sprites have an ID
- Portion of the code is commented, but not all
- Requires "Node-IDs" (v1.12.0 or above)

## To-do List

- Maybe additional chests like the milestones in the treasure room or the lite advertisement ones?
- Extra details.
